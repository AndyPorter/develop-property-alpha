      <p>By applying a lock, you are committing to making no more changes to the plot.</p>

      <p>A buyer will also need to commit to the purchase of the property, by adding their own lock.</p>

      <p>The locks will stay in place until the sale has completed, and the new owner has been registered.</p>

      <p>You will be able to remove your lock.  If there is also a buyerâ€™s lock, they will be notified.</p>
